Hi, I'm **Sanjay** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate **backend-focused fullstack developer** with a flair for design. I love building products from 0 to 100 (and beyond).

Although I'm unbounded by frameworks or languages, my go-to stack for building is **Python with Django/FastAPI and Node.js with TypeScript/Express.js/Next.js**, with a growing interest in Golang.

I recently built **[whatnot](https://whatnotapp.xyz/)**, a straightforward tool that syncs WhatsApp with Google Suite. Simply send WhatsApp messages to:
- Create notes in Google Docs.
- Schedule events on Google Calendar.
- Upload media messages to Google Drive.
- Set reminders and receive them as WhatsApp messages.

I also built a simple email category classifier [[link]](https://sortmail.vercel.app/). This app classifies your Gmail messages into several categories, helping you manage your emails more efficiently.

If you're intrigued by these projects and would like to give them a try, **reach out to me via email, Twitter DM, or LinkedIn DM**. I'm currently awaiting Google's OAuth verification and WhatsApp's Business Number verification. 
I'd be more than happy to add you as a test user.

I'm currently building an AI-assisted journaling app where you can log anything, such as your diet, macros, recipes, and workouts, and receive smart insights, summaries, etc. Starting with food, calories, and macros journaling, I plan to expand to finance and general life journaling.
