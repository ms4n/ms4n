Hi, I'm **Sanjay** ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **backend-focused fullstack developer** with a flair for design, passionate about building products from 0 to 100 (and beyond).

My go-to stack includes **Python (Django/FastAPI)** and **Node.js (TypeScript/Express.js/Next.js)**, with a growing interest in Golang.

I recently built **[whatnot](https://whatnotapp.xyz/)**, a tool to sync WhatsApp with Google Suite. Simply send WhatsApp messages to:
- Create Google Docs notes.
- Schedule Google Calendar events.
- Upload media to Google Drive.
- Set reminders via WhatsApp.

I also developed an email category classifier [[link]](https://sortmail.vercel.app/) to help manage Gmail messages efficiently.

I'm building an AI-assisted journaling app for logging diet, macros, recipes, and workouts, offering smart insights and summaries. Starting with food journaling, it will expand to finance and general life journaling.

If you're intrigued by these projects, **reach out to me via email, Twitter DM, or LinkedIn DM**. Iâ€™m currently awaiting Google OAuth and WhatsApp Business Number verification, but I'd be happy to add you as a test user.
